            <description><![CDATA[<p>Charles Mingus brought a fire and energy to the jazz world that had never been seen before! His compositions and the personnel in his bands were all thoroughly steeped in the swinging blues/jazz traditions, yet fiercely modern and avant guard for their time. Sydney baritone saxophonist Steve Fitzmaurice has brought these compositions to life again with his arrangements of the Mingus repertoire for the 9 piece powerhouse ensemble 'Mingus Amongst Us'. Featuring the best jazz musicians from all over the country, 'Mingus Amongst Us' perfectly captures the raucous, fiery energy that Mingus and his compositions were famous for. Being a regular sell out in Melbourne and Sydney, 'Mingus Amongst Us' hit the road to tour the release of their debut album 'Live @ Foundry 616. Catch them at any one of these major cities to experience a night of jazz like no otherâ€¦.it's a night you won't want to miss! QUOTES "It's raucous, just as Mingus would have liked it!" Jessica Nicholas ABC Jazz "Earthy, passionate and sophisticated, blues and gospel inspired jazz" Roger "There's so much energy in Mingus, so much of it is released by this ensemble" Roger</p>]]></description>
